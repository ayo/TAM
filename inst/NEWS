-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Versions 0.6 (2013-08-28)
-------------------------------------------------------

x fixed a bug when in latent regression when providing a formula
  in argument 'formulaY'
x fixed a bug in output of tam.se (thanks to Sebastian Weirich)
x included a faster alternative to tam.ctt -> tam.ctt2 is based
  on a Rcpp function
x allowed freeing beta constraints by the user by including
  the possible argument beta.fixed=FALSE
x removed a bug in data processing for faceted designs
  (thanks to Michaela Mayr)
x fixed a bug with varying string lengths of facet levels
x fixed a bug in tam.ctt2 for numeric input matrices
x fixed incorrect handling of constraints in regression coefficients
  which was just included in a recent 0.6 version
x fixed an output bug in tam.wle in multidimensional models
  (thanks to Jan Henning-Kahmann)
x accelerated estimation of multdimensional models (different
  approach of calculating the prior distribution)
x fixed a bug when submitting xsi.inits and beta.inits to tam
x fixed a bug in facet models when a facet contains only one
  element (twice thanks to Michaela Mayr)
x included irtmodel='PCM2' (partial credit model with ConQuest
  parametrization) and irtmodel='RSM' (rating scale model)
x added a longitudinal data example in 'tam.mml' manual

-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Versions 0.5 (2013-07-28)
-------------------------------------------------------

x included data.ex11 example dataset
x removed a bug in WLE calculation for multifaceted designs
x avoided warning in cov2cor for tam.mml.2pl function
  (thanks to Linda Graefe)
x included argument increment.factor for obtaining
  convergence behavior in bad suited data constellations
x changed default of np.adj in tam.pv to 8
x included two helper functions written in Rcpp in
  plausible value imputation function tam.pv for
  better performance
x included S3 plot method
x included data.numeracy and data.timssAusTwn
  datasets

-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Versions 0.4 (2013-07-01)
-------------------------------------------------------

x included quasi-Monte Carlo integration as an alternative
  to stochastic integration
x multifaceted model completely implemented
x print warning if there are items in resp with only zeroes
  (thanks to Ronny Scherer)
x fixed a bug in tam.wle, tam.pv and tam.se
x fixed a bug in creating design matrices for faceted designs
x changed initial xsi values for indetermined parameters
  (thanks to Sebastian Weirich)
x included function for calculating Thurstonian thresholds
x included Rcpp function in M step for calculating item parameters
x fixed a bug for partial credit models
x included parametrization of the dispersion model for ordered data
x included a function tam.ctt for calculating some statistics
  based on classical test theory
x fixed a bug in tam.mml.2pl with irtmodel="GPCM" for models
   with differering numbers of item categories

-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Versions 0.3 (2013-03-23)
-------------------------------------------------------

x cleaned Rd manual files a bit
x included standard errors in tam.mml and tam.mml.2pl
x included summary.tam and summary.tam.mml
x included anova.tam for model comparisons
x fixed a bug in multiple group estimation during tam.mml and
   summary application
x fixed a bug in WLE estimation in the multdimensional case

-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Versions 0.2 (2013-02-20)
-------------------------------------------------------

x removed bugs in tam.pv for sampling plausible values
  with the argument normal.approx=FALSE 
  (thanks to Sebastian Weirich)
x included seed for stochastic integration in the tam
  control argument
x fixed a bug in stochastic integration
  (thanks to Steffen Brandt)
x fixed a bug in the calculation of reliability and person
  parameter estimates when applying stochastic integration
  (thanks to Steffen Brandt and Caroline Just)
x use estimated parameters with minimal deviance in the output
  (thanks to Ulrich Schroeders and Steffen Brandt)

-------------------------------------------------------
Changes in Version 0.1-03 (2012-11-21)
-------------------------------------------------------

 x 2PL calibration outsourced
 x designMatrices and tam.mml.mfr method for multifacet rasch model 
   calibration included. Both highly experimental.
 x Examples for the calibration included, see help file of sim.mfr
